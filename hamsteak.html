                The ham steak is suited with a mango flavoured salad as a side dish, complemented by a hot sweet chili sauce

        <li>
            Ham
            Mango
            Salad
            Salt
            Pepper
        </li>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Season the steak with a lot of salt and pepper.
                Sear the steak in the pan to give the ham a nice crust, keeping the juice within the ham while heating
                Put the ham in the oven for about 2 hours.
                Prepare the mango salad in the meantime
                Take out the ham when the degree has reached 70 celcius
            </li>
        </ol>
